All the things we thought we knew about biology and sex determination are up for debate in a way that feels both daunting and full of potential. At the same time, we're at a moment where we’re wrestling with how to approach conversations around sex, consent, and boundaries, at a time that may be more divisive than ever. So host Molly Webster thought: what if we took on sex ed, and tried to tackle questions from listeners, youth, reddit (oh boy), and staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;But instead of approaching these questions the way your high school health teacher might’ve (or government teacher, who knows), Molly invited a cast of storytellers, educators, artists, and comedians to grapple with sex ed in unexpected and thoughtful ways. To help us think about how we can change the conversation. In this episode, an edited down version of a Gonads Live show, Molly's team takes a crack at responding to the intimate questions you asked when you were younger but probably never got a straight answer to. Featuring:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Do You Talk About Condoms Without Condom Demonstrations?&lt;/strong&gt; Sanford Johnson.

As Amir says, they wanted to say "a big thank you." These meetings between intended parents, surrogate, and new babies are a traditional part of the surrogacy process in India and Nepal, and we heard reports from the surrogates that they also look forward to them. These moments do not stigmatize, reveal the identity of, or endanger the surrogates.

But when her son Alex was in a bad car accident, she decided to stay home to help him recover. And then, rather suddenly, she decided to quit science altogether and become a full-time artist. After that, her husband &lt;span&gt;Robert Adams&lt;/span&gt; tells us, she just painted and painted and painted. First houses and buildings, then a series of paintings involving strawberries, and then ...

For some reason, Astronaut Mark Vande Hei chose us. A couple weeks ago, we were able to video chat with Mark and peer over his shoulder through the Cupola, an observatory room in the ISS. Traveling at 17,000 miles an hour, we zoomed from the Rockies to the East Coast in minutes. And from where Mark sits, the total darkness of space isn’t very far away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking to Mark brought us back to 2012, when we spoke to another astronaut, Dave Wolf. When we were putting together our live show &lt;em&gt;In the Dark&lt;/em&gt;, Jad and Robert called up Dave Wolf to ask him if he had any stories about darkness. And boy, did he. Dave told us two stories that  became the finale of our show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px;" src="https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/imagery/photos/sts-86/86p-036.jpg" alt="" width="300"&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px;" src="https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/imagery/photos/sts-86/86p-027.jpg" alt="" width="300"&gt;Back in late 1997, Dave Wolf was on his first spacewalk, to perform work on the Mir (the photo to the right was taken during that mission, courtesy of &lt;a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/sts86/photo/sts-86-photo-36.htm" target="_blank"&gt;NASA.&lt;/a&gt;). Dave wasn't alone -- with him was veteran Russian cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev. (That's a picture of Dave giving Anatoly a hug on board the Mir, also courtesy of &lt;a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/sts86/photo/sts-86-photo-27.htm" target="_blank"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out in blackness of space, the contrast between light and dark is almost unimaginably extreme -- every 45 minutes, you plunge between absolute darkness on the night-side of Earth, and blazing light as the sun screams into view. Dave and Anatoly were tethered to the spacecraft, traveling 5 miles per second. That's 16 times faster than we travel on Earth's surface as it rotates -- so as they orbited, they experienced 16 nights and 16 days for every Earth day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave's description of his first spacewalk was all we could've asked for, and more. But what happened next ... well, it's just one of those stories that you always hope an astronaut will tell. Dave and Anatoly were ready to call it a job and head back into the Mir when something went wrong with the airlock. They couldn't get it to re-pressurize. In other words, they were locked out. After hours of trying to fix the airlock, they were running out of the resources that kept them alive in their space suits and facing a grisly death. So, they unhooked their tethers, and tried one last desperate move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, they made it through, and Dave went on to perform dozens more spacewalks in the years to come, but he never again experienced anything like those harrowing minutes trying to improvise his way back into the Mir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that terrifying tale, Dave told us about another moment he and Anatoly shared, floating high above Earth, staring out into the universe ... a moment so beautiful, and peaceful, we decided to use the audience recreate it, as best we could, for the final act of our live show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilobolus creates a shadow astronaut during Dave Wolf's story on stage (photo by Lars Topelmann):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.wnyc.org/media/photologue/images/bb/itd_astro_shadow_MG_9001.jpg" alt="" width="620"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audience turns Portland's Keller auditorium into a view of outer space with thousands of LED lights (photo by Lars Topelmann):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.wnyc.org/media/photologue/images/29/itd_leds_MG_0717.jpg" alt="" width="620"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's Dave Wolf in the dark darkness of space, performing a spacewalk in 2009 (courtesy of &lt;a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-127/html/s127e007210.html" target="_blank"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.wnyc.org/media/photologue/images/3e/s127e007096.jpg" alt="" width="620"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of what it looks like during the brightness of day, here's another photo taken in 2009 -- more than a decade after the adventure described in our podcast -- this time of astronaut Tom Marshburn (Dave Wolf is with him, out of frame, photo courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1425.html" target="_blank"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.wnyc.org/media/photologue/images/56/Astro_TM_372055main_image_1425_1024_768.jpg" alt="" width="620"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was produced by Matt Kielty and Soren Wheeler. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Support Radiolab today at &lt;a href="https://pledge3.wnyc.org/donate/radiolab-it/onestep/?utm_source=podcast&amp;amp;utm_medium=notes&amp;amp;utm_campaign=membership&amp;amp;utm_content=radiolab"&gt;Radiolab.org/donate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Apr 2018 18:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">f3d48e8e-ec94-4750-be35-55f12345555c</guid><enclosure url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast18darksideearth.mp3?aisGetOriginalStream=true" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><category>astronaut</category><category>nasa</category><category>space</category><category>storytelling</category><media:content url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast18darksideearth.mp3?aisGetOriginalStream=true" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:description type="plain">Dark Side of the Earth</media:description><media:thumbnail url="https://media.wnyc.org/i/130/130/h/80/photologue/images/ca/s127e007210_1.jpg" width="130" height="130" /><itunes:duration>27:37</itunes:duration><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Astronauts at the International Space Station can make one request to talk to an earthling of their choice.

So, they unhooked their tethers, and tried one last desperate move.</p><p>In the end, they made it through, and Dave went on to perform dozens more spacewalks in the years to come, but he never again experienced anything like those harrowing minutes trying to improvise his way back into the Mir.</p><p>After that terrifying tale, Dave told us about another moment he and Anatoly shared, floating high above Earth, staring out into the universe ... a moment so beautiful, and peaceful, we decided to use the audience recreate it, as best we could, for the final act of our live show.</p><p><em>This episode was produced by Matt Kielty and Soren Wheeler. </em></p><p><em>Support Radiolab today at <a href="https://pledge3.wnyc.org/donate/radiolab-it/onestep/?utm_source=podcast&amp;utm_medium=notes&amp;utm_campaign=membership&amp;utm_content=radiolab">Radiolab.org/donate</a>.</em></p>]]></itunes:summary><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">WNYC Studios</dc:creator><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:subtitle>Astronauts at the International Space Station can make one request to talk to an earthling of their choice.

Then along comes a new craze: football. A brutally violent game where young men can show a stadium full of fans just what they're made of.

It’s a pretty straightforward bit of moral math. But if we have to actually kill that person ourselves, the math gets fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the lesson of the classic Trolley Problem, a moral puzzle that fried our brains in an episode we did about 11 years ago. Luckily, the Trolley Problem has always been little more than a thought experiment, mostly confined to conversations at a certain kind of cocktail party. That is until now.

Whenever a bomb detonated, they could zoom onto that spot and then, because this eye in the sky had been there all along, they could scroll back in time and see - literally see - who planted it. After the war, Ross McNutt retired from the Air Force, and brought this technology back home with him. Manoush Zomorodi and Alex Goldmark from the podcast “Note to Self” give us the lowdown on Ross’s unique brand of persistent surveillance, from Juarez, Mexico to Dayton, Ohio. Then, once we realize what we can do, we wonder whether we should.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Produced by Andy Mills.

He had been kicked out of college, was cleaning toilets by day, delivering pizzas by night and spending his weekends in jail. Then one night he heard a story on the radio and got it in his head that maybe he too could make a great radio story. He’d cast himself as the main character in a great documentary and he’d travel and &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; and steer his way out of his rut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he bought a recorder and began to secretly record every last meaningful and mundane minute of his life and he found his great idea transformed into a troubling obsession. The very thing that gave him hope and purpose was also distancing him from those he loved the most.

The plaintiff was Abigail Fisher, a white woman, who said she was rejected from the University of Texas because the university unfairly considered race as one of many factors when evaluating applicants. And while Fisher’s claims were the focus of the case, the story behind how she ended up in front of the Supreme Court is a lot more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="https://media2.wnyc.org/i/304/423/l/80/1/imageedit_1_5483384188.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;div class="image-metadata"&gt;&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;Edward Blum is the director of the Project on Fair Representation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;(AEI) &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this episode, we visit Edward Blum, a 64-year-old “legal entrepreneur” and former stockbroker who has become something of a Supreme Court matchmaker — He takes an issue, finds the perfect plaintiff, matches them with lawyers, and works his way to the highest court in the land. He’s had remarkable success, with 6 cases heard before the Supreme Court, including that of Abigail Fisher. We also head to Houston, Texas, where in 1998, an unusual 911 call led to one of the most important LGBT rights decisions in the Supreme Court’s history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="https://media2.wnyc.org/i/646/486/l/80/1/tyronlawrence2.JPG" alt=""&gt;&lt;div class="image-metadata"&gt;&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;John Lawrence (L) and Tyron Garner (R) at the 2004 Pride Parade in Houston&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;(J.D.

To hear more, subscribe &lt;a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolabmoreperfect/episodes/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Chief Justice Earl Warren was asked at the end of his career, “What was the most important case of your tenure?”, there were a lot of answers he could have given. After all, he had presided over some of the most important decisions in the court’s history — cases that dealt with segregation in schools, the right to an attorney, the right to remain silent, just to name a few. But his answer was a surprise: He said, “Baker v. Carr,” a 1962 redistricting case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this episode of &lt;em&gt;More Perfect&lt;/em&gt;, we talk about why this case was so important; important enough, in fact, that it pushed one Supreme Court justice to a nervous breakdown, brought a boiling feud to a head, put one justice in the hospital, and changed the course of the Supreme Court — and the nation — forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="https://media2.wnyc.org/i/800/800/l/80/1/pjimage_b6uICRg.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;div class="image-metadata"&gt;&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;Associate Justice William O.

And a whole universe of medical and moral questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Technology has had a profound effect on how we get pregnant, give birth, and think about life and death. The decision to become parents was not an easy one for Kelley and Tom. Even after they sorted out their relationship issues and hopes for the future, getting pregnant wasn't easy. But, thanks to a lot of technology, they found a way to a baby. Then, about halfway through the pregnancy, the trouble began. Neonatal nurse practitioner Diane Loisel describes helping Kelley and Tom make the most important decision of their lives. And Nita Farahany helps Jad and Robert understand the significance of viability, and how technology has influenced its meaning...making a difficult idea even harder to pin down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kelley and Tom had hoped that meeting their daughter would be the happiest moment of their life. But when she came early -- at just 23 weeks and 6 days, that moment was full of terror and an impossibly difficult decision. And when the time came to face it, Tom and Kelley turned to their baby for help. Seeing their daughter for the first time, they looked for her to "declare herself." That's a phrase that comes up again and again to help guide decisions in Neonatal Intensive Care Units. But parents and medical professionals have very different ideas about what the phrase really means. Nurse Tracy Hullet and Neonatologist Keith Barrington describe the difficulty of interpreting the fuzzy boundary between a baby's strength of will, and simple physiology. Meanwhile Kelley and Tom are left to wonder, and wait.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, or NICU, is a land of emotional and medical limbo. Kelley, Tom, and their daughter Juniper got stranded in this limbo for months, fighting to survive, and finally get to the next chapter of their lives. Their doctor, Fauzia Shakeel, describes the moment when Juniper's life hung in the balance, and Keith Barrington helps us understand how our newest technologies open the door not only to hope, but also to a pain that we, as humans, have kept hidden for most of our history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, Kelley, Tom, Nita Farahany and Juniper herself, nearly 5 years old, give us an update on her life and what has happened since our story originally aired. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="https://media2.wnyc.org/i/640/1136/l/80/1/IMG_8460.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;div class="image-metadata"&gt;&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;Juniper and Kelley&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;(Photo Credit: Kelley Benham)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2016 00:36:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.radiolab.org/story/update-23-weeks-6-days/</guid><enclosure url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast16update23weeks.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><category>birth</category><category>life</category><category>medicine</category><category>pregnancy</category><category>science</category><category>spotify_rl</category><category>storytelling</category><category>viability</category><media:content url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast16update23weeks.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:description type="plain">Update: 23 Weeks 6 Days</media:description><media:thumbnail url="https://media.wnyc.org/i/130/130/c/80/1/Kelley_juniper_4.15greathatphoto.jpg" width="130" height="130" /><itunes:duration>62:57</itunes:duration><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An update on Juniper French, a tiny baby, born at 23 Weeks and 6 days -- roughly halfway to full term.

But as the show succeeded, it started to change the way we thought not only of reality television, but also of reality itself.  Looking back at the show now, a half century later, it’s hard NOT to see so many of our preoccupations – privacy, propriety, publicity, authenticity – through a funhouse mirror, darkly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reported by Latif Nasser.

Over the years he has shared with us stories of chemistry, music, neurology, hallucinations and more, so much more. Because Oliver notices the world and the people around him with scientific rigor, with insight, and most importantly, with deep empathy. ‪When he announced a few months ago that he had terminal cancer and wasn't going to do any more interviews, we asked him if he'd talk with us one last time. He said yes‬. So Robert went, as he has done for 30 some years now, to his apartment with a microphone, this time to ask him about the forces that have driven him in his work, in his unique relationships with his patients, and in his own life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This performance was scored live by the incomparable Sarah Lipstate/Noveller. &lt;a href="http://www.sarahlipstate.com/"&gt;Her new album Fantastic Planet is out now. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lullabies you hear in "Dr. Sacks Looks Back" are sung by Carrie Erving, whose current project is &lt;a href="http://www.ponyhofmusic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Ponyhof&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Though it probably goes without saying, &lt;a href="http://www.oliversacks.com/books-by-oliver-sacks/on-the-move/"&gt;we highly recommend Dr. Sacks' new autobiorgraphy, On The Move. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2015 18:57:22 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.radiolab.org/story/remembering-oliver-sacks/</guid><enclosure url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/rl_extras/rl_extras15rememberingoliver.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><category>cancer</category><category>emotional</category><category>oliver_sacks</category><category>science</category><category>storytelling</category><media:content url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/rl_extras/rl_extras15rememberingoliver.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:description type="plain">Remembering Oliver Sacks</media:description><media:thumbnail url="https://media.wnyc.org/i/130/130/l/80/1/Sacks2.jpg" width="130" height="130" /><itunes:duration>25:50</itunes:duration><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In memory of one of our dear friends, a re-release of our last conversation with Dr. Oliver Sacks.  </p>]]></content:encoded><itunes:title>Remembering Oliver Sacks</itunes:title><itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In memory of one of our dear friends, a re-release of our last conversation with Dr. Oliver Sacks.  </p>]]></itunes:summary><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">WNYC Studios</dc:creator><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:subtitle> In memory of one of our dear friends and one of the truest inspirations for Radiolab, a re-release of the last conversation we had with Dr. Oliver Sacks.  When Radiolab was just starting out, Robert asked Dr. Oliver Sacks if he could help us, maybe send </itunes:subtitle><itunes:author>WNYC Studios</itunes:author><itunes:keywords>Science,Technology,Philosophy,Education,radiolab,jad,abumrad,krulwich,Radio,Lab,wnyc,studios</itunes:keywords></item><item><title>Elements</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/elements/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists took about 300 years to lay out the Periodic Table into neat rows and columns.

This is the story of a few documents that tumbled out and offered a glimpse of histories waiting to be rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When professor Caroline Elkins came across a stray document left by the British colonial government in Nairobi, Kenya, she opened the door to a new reckoning with the history of one of Britain's colonial crown jewels, and the fearsome group of rebels known as the Mau Mau. We talk to historians, archivists, journalists and send our producer Jamie York to visit the Mau Mau. As the new history of Kenya is concealed and revealed, document by document, we wonder what else lies in wait among the miles of records hidden away in Hanslope Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Produced by Matt Kielty with reporting from Jamie York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattathias Schwartz for first bringing us this story. Martin Mavenjina and Faith Alubbe of the &lt;a href="http://www.khrc.or.ke/"&gt;Kenyan Human Rights Commission&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nyakinyua Kenda for the use of their music, Rose Mutiso and Anne Moko for translation help, and Sruthi Pinnamaneni for production support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="divSelDisplay"&gt;&lt;div id="divExpSubHdr"&gt;&lt;div id="divSubFs"&gt;&lt;div id="divFs"&gt;&lt;div class="divTx"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="divBdy" class="bdyItmPrt" _fallwcm="1"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this episode contained two errors, which we have corrected. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first was our mention of Israel as a former British colony where official documents were purged. In fact, Israel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt; was a successor to the British mandated territory of Palestine, which we also listed, and so we removed the redundancy. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second was that we qualified our statement about Kikuyu support for the Mau Mau. Some listeners misinterpreted our claim that support for the Mau Mau cut across all demographics among the Kikuyu to mean that all Kikuyu supported the Mau Mau, which is untrue. We tempered the language in that spot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 00:43:41 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.radiolab.org/story/mau-mau/</guid><enclosure url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast15maumau.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><category>colonial_history</category><category>colonialism</category><category>england</category><category>history</category><category>kenya</category><category>storytelling</category><media:content url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast15maumau.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:description type="plain">Mau Mau </media:description><media:thumbnail url="https://media.wnyc.org/i/130/130/l/80/1/Mau_Mau_Hhe7utz.jpg" width="130" height="130" /><itunes:duration>43:25</itunes:duration><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the story of a few documents that tumbled out of the secret archives of the biggest empire the world has ever known, offering a glimpse of histories waiting to be rewritten.</p>]]></content:encoded><itunes:title>Mau Mau </itunes:title><itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>This is the story of a few documents that tumbled out of the secret archives of the biggest empire the world has ever known, offering a glimpse of histories waiting to be rewritten.</p>]]></itunes:summary><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">WNYC Studios</dc:creator><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:subtitle> This is the story of a few documents that tumbled out of the secret archives of the biggest empire the world has ever known, offering a glimpse of histories waiting to be rewritten.

We examine how just 60 words of legal language have blurred the line between war and peace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the hours after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a lawyer sat down in front of a computer and started writing a legal justification for taking action against those responsible. The language that he drafted and that President George W. Bush signed into law - called the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) -  has at its heart one single sentence, 60 words long. Over the last decade, those 60 words have become the legal foundation for the "war on terror."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this collaboration with BuzzFeed, reporter Gregory Johnsen tells us the story of how this has come to be one of the most important, confusing, troubling sentences of the past 12 years. We go into the meetings that took place in the chaotic days just after 9/11, speak with Congresswoman Barbara Lee and former Congressman Ron Dellums about the vote on the AUMF. We hear from former White House and State Department lawyers John Bellinger &amp;amp; Harold Koh. We learn how this legal language unleashed Guantanamo, Navy Seal raids and drone strikes. And we speak with journalist Daniel Klaidman, legal expert Benjamin Wittes and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine about how these words came to be interpreted, and what they mean for the future of war and peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Produced by Matt Kielty and Kelsey Padgett with original music by Dylan Keefe. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This episode is included in the Radiolab #smartbinge podcast playlist at &lt;a href="http://wnyc.org/smartbinge"&gt;wnyc.org/smartbinge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.radiolab.org/story/60-words/</guid><enclosure url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab/radiolab041814.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><category>guantanamo</category><category>national_security</category><category>politics</category><category>war_on_terror</category><media:content url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab/radiolab041814.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:description type="plain">60 Words</media:description><media:thumbnail url="https://media.wnyc.org/i/130/130/h/80/1/siteimageFIN.jpeg" width="130" height="130" /><itunes:duration>55:54</itunes:duration><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This hour we pull apart one sentence, written in the hours after September 11th, 2001, that has led to the longest war in U.S. history.

But as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker's&lt;/em&gt; Andrew Marantz explains, massive commercial success is a tightrope walk for any genre of popular music, and especially one built on authenticity and “realness.”  Hip-hop constantly runs the risk of becoming a watered-down imitation of its former self - just, you know, &lt;em&gt;pop music&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew introduces us to Peter Rosenberg, a guy who takes this doomsday scenario very seriously. Peter is a DJ at Hot 97, New York City’s iconic hip-hop station, and a vocal booster of what he calls “real” hip-hop. But as a Jewish fellow from suburban Maryland, he's also the first to admit that he's an unlikely arbiter for what is and what isn't hip-hop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest and NPR's Frannie Kelley, we explore the strange ways that hip-hop deals with that age-old question: are you in or are you out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to The New Yorker who let us do a radiophonic version of their piece. If you've got a New Yorker subscription check out Andrew Marantz's stellar written version &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/04/07/140407fa_fact_marantz?mbid=social_retweet?mbid=social_retweet"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

They bite. And they have killed more people than cancer, war, or heart disease. Here’s the question: If you could wipe mosquitoes off the face of the planet, would you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever since there have been humans, mosquitoes have been biting us, and we’ve been trying to kill them. And, for the most part, the mosquitoes have been winning. Today there are over 3000 species on pretty much every corner of Earth. Mosquito-borne diseases kill around 1 million people a year (most of them children) and make more than 500 million people sick. But thanks to Hadyn Perry and his team of scientists, that might be about to change. Producer Andy Mills talks with author Sonia Shah about the difficulties of sharing a planet with mosquitoes and with science writer David Quammen about the risks of getting rid of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and we visit a mosquito factory in eastern Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And after listening, read this, from Radiolab producer Andy Mills: &lt;a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/what-if-we-dont-kill-em-all/" target="_blank"&gt;what if we don't kill 'em all?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.davidbakeronline.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to reporter David Baker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 18:59:41 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.radiolab.org/story/kill-em-all/</guid><enclosure url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast14killemall.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><category>discovery_dialogues</category><category>mosquitoes</category><category>science</category><category>shorts</category><category>storytelling</category><media:content url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast14killemall.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:description type="plain">KILL 'EM ALL</media:description><media:thumbnail url="https://media.wnyc.org/i/130/130/l/80/1/mosquito1.jpeg" width="130" height="130" /><itunes:duration>21:28</itunes:duration><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They buzz.

It’s such a perfect deflection that it seems like it’s been around forever, but reporter &lt;a href="http://www.juliabarton.com"&gt;Julia Barton&lt;/a&gt; takes us back to the 1970s and the surprising origin story of what’s now known as a “Glomar Response.” With help from David Sharp and Walt Logan, we tell the story of a clandestine CIA operation to lift a sunken Soviet submarine from the ocean floor and the dilemma they faced when the world found out about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 40 years since that operation, the Glomar Response has become boilerplate language from an array of government agencies. With help from ProPublica editor Jeff Larson and NPR’s Dina Temple-Raston, we explore the implications of this ultimate information dodge. ACLU lawyer Jameel Jaffer explains how it stymies oversight, and we learn that, even 40 years later, governmental secrecy can be emotionally painful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After listening to the story ... &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt;After 40 years, many of the details of Project Azorian are only now coming to light. The US government’s default position has been to keep as much of it classified as possible. It took three years for retired CIA employee David Sharp to get permission &lt;a href="http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/shacia.html"&gt;to publish his account&lt;/a&gt; of Project Azorian. And FOIA played an indirect role in that, as Cold War historians got the CIA to release, in redacted form, &lt;a href="http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb305/"&gt;an internal history of the mission&lt;/a&gt;. After that and a threat of legal action, Sharp was finally able to publish his manuscript in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt;We mentioned conspiracy theories that have swirled around Project Azorian filling the void where official silence has reigned. One of them is promulgated in the 2005 book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Red-Star-Rogue-Submarines-Nuclear/dp/1416527338"&gt;“Red Star Rogue” by Kenneth Sewell and Clint Richmond.&lt;/a&gt; They posit that the K-129 was taken over by rogue Stalinist KGB agents in order to start a nuclear conflict. But the conflict was to be between the US and China, as, according to the authors, the sub had powers to disguise its sonic signature as a Chinese Navy vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt;This book is the basis of the 2013 drama &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1922685/"&gt;“Phantom,”&lt;/a&gt; which features Ed Harris and David Duchovny as Soviet military officers who sip vodka in a very un-Russian way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt;Russian Naval historians, &lt;a href="http://www.northfleet.ru/"&gt;like Nikolai Cherkashin&lt;/a&gt;, are not only insulted by this take on the cause of the K-129’s demise, they say the true cause is much easier to pinpoint: They say an American vessel, possibly the USS Swordfish, &lt;a href="http://english.pravda.ru/news/russia/10-09-2007/96959-sunken_submarine-0/"&gt;collided with the Soviet submarine.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite the fact that the US government has turned over many documents about Project Azorian and what it found to the Russian government, many in the Russian Navy stand by their theory that it was far too easy for the US to locate the K-129 on the bottom of the Pacific, given the technology of the time. According to these theories, Project Azorian was nothing more than an elaborate cover-up disguised as... an elaborate cover-up. We can neither confirm nor deny that we exactly understand how that would have worked in practice or execution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt;But for our money, there’s probably no stranger and more telling document from this time &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFWMo7aHDRo&amp;amp;noredirect=1"&gt;than a video of the funeral at sea for Soviet sailors&lt;/a&gt; ostensibly recovered by the US during Project Azorian.

Eulogies and rites are performed in both English and Russian (albeit with an American accent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s one of the more solemn moments of the Cold War, and one that the Glomar Response helped keep a secret for a very long time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2014 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.radiolab.org/story/confirm-nor-deny/</guid><enclosure url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast14glomar.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><category>cia</category><category>cold war [lc]</category><category>politics</category><category>shorts</category><category>technology</category><media:content url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast14glomar.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:description type="plain">Neither Confirm Nor Deny</media:description><media:thumbnail url="https://media.wnyc.org/i/130/130/l/80/1/Glomar.jpg" width="130" height="130" /><itunes:duration>25:48</itunes:duration><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p><p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr">How a sunken nuclear submarine, a crazy billionaire, and a mechanical claw gave birth to a phrase that has hounded journalists and lawyers for 40 years and embodies the tension between the public’s desire for transparency and the government’s need to keep secrets.  </p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded><itunes:title>Neither Confirm Nor Deny</itunes:title><itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p> </p><p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr">How a sunken nuclear submarine, a crazy billionaire, and a mechanical claw gave birth to a phrase that has hounded journalists and lawyers for 40 years and embodies the tension between the public’s desire for transparency and the government’s need to keep secrets.  </p><p> </p>]]></itunes:summary><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">WNYC Studios</dc:creator><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:subtitle> How a sunken nuclear submarine, a crazy billionaire, and a mechanical claw gave birth to a phrase that has hounded journalists and lawyers for 40 years and embodies the tension between the public’s desire for transparency and the government’s need to kee</itunes:subtitle><itunes:author>WNYC Studios</itunes:author><itunes:keywords>Science,Technology,Philosophy,Education,radiolab,jad,abumrad,krulwich,Radio,Lab,wnyc,studios</itunes:keywords></item><item><title>Brown Box</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/brown-box/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;You order some stuff on the Internet and it shows up three hours later.

In this short, we stumble across a surprising, and sort of terrifying, explanation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the 1968 summer Olympics in Mexico City, Kipchoge Keino overcame a gall bladder infection to win gold in the 1500 meter race. Since then, one particular group of Kenyans - the Kalenjin - has produced an astonishing number of great long-distance runners. &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/people/172020165/gregory-warner" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gregory Warner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - NPR's East Africa correspondent - takes Jad and Robert down a rabbit hole of theories about what exactly is going on in Kalenjin country. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Epstein&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;John Manners&lt;/strong&gt; help Greg untangle a web of potential factors - from something in the cornmeal to simple economics.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;And, after talking to a young Kalenjin runner named &lt;strong&gt;Elly &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kipgogei&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;Greg discovers a somewhat disturbing explanation for Kalenjin running prowess that actually makes him want to get on the treadmill and push himself just a little harder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out a video of Kipchoge Keino's 1968 Olympic 1500m run:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="465" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/P6Lo7A9y9pU" width="620"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2013 17:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.radiolab.org/story/runners/</guid><enclosure url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast13runners.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><category>kenya</category><category>life</category><category>pain</category><category>runners</category><category>running</category><category>science</category><category>shorts</category><category>sports</category><media:content url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast13runners.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:description type="plain">Cut and Run</media:description><media:thumbnail url="https://media.wnyc.org/i/130/130/c/80/1/kenyan_runners.jpg" width="130" height="130" /><itunes:duration>25:07</itunes:duration><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Legions of athletes, sports gurus, and scientists have tried to figure out why Kenyans dominate long-distance running.

But these days, quicksand can't even scare an 8-year-old. In this short, we try to find out why. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Producer Soren Wheeler introduces us to Dan Engber, writer and columnist for &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;, who ran across a strange fact: kids are no longer afraid of quicksand. To figure out what happened to quicksand, Dan immersed himself in research, compiled mountains of data, and met with quicksand fetishists. Dan tells Soren and Robert about his journey, and shares his theory about why the terror of his childhood seems to have lost its menacing allure. And Carlton Cuse, best-known as writer and executive producer of &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;, weighs in on whether giant pits of hero-swallowing mud might one day creep back into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.wnyc.org/i/raw/1/quicksand_movies_graph_620.png" alt="" width="620" height="299"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan Engber's data on the percentage of movies released that feature quicksand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2013 18:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.radiolab.org/story/quicksand/</guid><enclosure url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast13quicksand.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><category>life</category><category>movies</category><category>quicksand</category><category>science</category><category>shorts</category><media:content url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast13quicksand.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:description type="plain">Quicksaaaand!</media:description><media:thumbnail url="https://media.wnyc.org/i/130/130/l/80/1/drijfzand.jpg" width="130" height="130" /><itunes:duration>15:59</itunes:duration><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many of us, quicksand was once a real fear -- it held a vise-grip on our imaginations, from childish sandbox games to grown-up anxieties about venturing into unknown lands.

If you ask Ally Manning's mom and sister, they'll tell you there's no question: they're black. But as a teenager, Ally decided that what was true for them didn't make sense for her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lu explains how the complex racial history of two towns in Ohio leads members of the same family to disagree strongly about whether they're black or white. And Ally, along with her mom Clarice and her sister Carlotta, wrestles with what it means to choose a different identity from her closest relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ally Manning, Clarice Shreck’s daughter, takes a moment before heading work to read a poem she wrote about her mom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.wnyc.org/i/raw/1/Ally_Lloyd_Cederstrand_web.jpg" alt="" width="620"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stateofthereunion/8206838920/in/photostream/" target="_blank"&gt;Photo: Lloyd Cederdstrand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlotta Hixon and her mom Clarice Shreck:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.wnyc.org/i/raw/1/Carlotta_Clarice_Lloyd_Cederstrand_web_1.jpg" alt="" width="620"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stateofthereunion/8205771705/in/photostream/" target="_blank"&gt;Photo: Lloyd Cederstrand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="https://www.wnyc.org/i/raw/1/OHC_Logo_w_txt_BLK.jpg" alt="" width="75"&gt;A version of this story, “As Black As We Wish to Be,” was sponsored by &lt;a href="http://ohiohillcountry.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Ohio’s Hill Country Heritage Area&lt;/a&gt; and made possible with funding from the &lt;a href="http://www.ohiohumanities.org" target="_blank"&gt;Ohio Humanities Council&lt;/a&gt;.

It might also be deeply flawed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this short, Jad and Robert talk to a writer and two physicists who are all grappling with versions of the same enormous question: is it possible to understand everything, or are we chasing an impossible dream... one built on questions that always lead to more questions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Hollowell&lt;/strong&gt; kicks things off with her gorgeous short story "A History of Everything, Including You." It's a powerful tale with a sweeping scope -- the history not just of one couple, but everything that led to them -- distilled into a poetic crush of just a few pages. The piece was born out of a sense of frustration Jenny felt about trying to account for "everything" in order to understand her life. And in many ways, her solution speaks to an eerily similar moment of uncertainty in physics. Inspired by an essay written by physicist and novelist &lt;strong&gt;Alan Lightman&lt;/strong&gt;, Robert pays a visit to &lt;strong&gt;Brian Greene&lt;/strong&gt; to ask if the latest developments in theoretical physics spell a crisis for science -- where we find we've reached the limit of what we can see and test, and are left with mathematical equations that can't be verified by experiments or observation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jenny Hollowell's "A History of Everything, Including You" can be found in the anthology &lt;span class="book"&gt;&lt;a title="buy this book at Amazon" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393328015/radiolabbooks-20/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Sudden Fiction: Short-Short Stories from America and Beyond&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alan Lightman's essay for Harper's Magazine "&lt;a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2011/12/the-accidental-universe/" target="_blank"&gt;The Accidental Universe: Science’s crisis of faith&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2013 17:49:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/jun/13/trouble-everything/</guid><enclosure url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast13everything.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><category>alan_lightman</category><category>brian_greene</category><category>faith</category><category>fiction</category><category>jenny_hollowell</category><category>physics</category><category>shorts</category><media:content url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast13everything.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:description type="plain">The Trouble with Everything</media:description><media:thumbnail url="https://media.wnyc.org/i/130/130/c/80/1/NASA_elephants_trunk_nebula_PIA04935_crop.jpg" width="130" height="130" /><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The desire to trace your way back to the very beginning, to understand everything -- whether it's the mysteries of love or the mechanics of the universe -- is deeply human.

Baby Girl</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/295210-adoptive-couple-v-baby-girl/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is the story of a three-year-old girl and the highest court in the land. The Supreme Court case &lt;em&gt;Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl&lt;/em&gt; is a legal battle that has entangled a biological father, a heart-broken couple, and the tragic history of Native American children taken from their families.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When producer &lt;a href="http://www.radiolab.org/people/tim-howard/"&gt;Tim Howard&lt;/a&gt; first read about this case, it struck him as a sad but seemingly straightforward custody dispute. But, as he started talking to lawyers and historians and the families involved in the case, it became clear that it was much more than that. Because &lt;em&gt;Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl &lt;/em&gt;challenges parts of the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, this case puts one little girl at the center of a storm of legal intricacies, Native American tribal culture, and heart-wrenching personal stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: The Supreme Court has made its ruling in &lt;em&gt;Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl&lt;/em&gt;.

In this short, Jad and Robert talk to a man who gets inside that noise to dissect its meaning and musical components.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While most of us hear a wall of white noise, squeaks, and squawks....David Rothenberg hears a symphony. He's trained his ear to listen for the music of animals, and he's always looking for chances to join in, with everything from lonely birds to giant whales to swarming cicadas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this podcast, David explains his urge to connect and sing along, and helps break down the mysterious life cycle and mating rituals of the periodical cicadas into something we can all relate to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.wnyc.org/i/raw/1/david_rothenberg_playing_cicadas_bug_music.jpg" alt="" width="620"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Rothenberg making music with the cicadas.&lt;a href="http://www.bugmusicbook.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Courtesy of David Rothenberg/Bug Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A visual breakdown of the cicada mating calls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.wnyc.org/i/raw/1/cooley_marshall_cicada_calls.jpg" alt="" width="620"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bugmusicbook.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy of John Cooley and David Marshall at UConn&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;For more on cicada mating calls, take a look at this &lt;a href="http://www.magicicada.org/cooley/reprints/Cooley_Marshall_2001.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;paper from Cooley and Marshall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close-up of cicadas getting down:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.wnyc.org/i/raw/1/cicada_sex_bug_music.jpg" alt="" width="620"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bugmusicbook.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy of David Rothenberg/Bug Music&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy a free download of our favorite track from David's CD &lt;a href="http://www.bugmusicbook.com/#!music/czas" target="_blank"&gt;Bug Music&lt;/a&gt; -- here's the description from the liner notes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katydid Prehistory: Named in honor of Archaboilus musicus, the 165 million year old prehistoric katydid, whose fossil remains reveal an ability to sing distinct pitches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="inline_audioplayer_wrapper"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Katydid Prehistory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div id="audioplayer_idm140205803086160eaa66af3-a733-4790-986d-95d7b5524e65" class="player_element" data-url="http://audio4.wnyc.org/rl_extras/rl_extras051413katydid.mp3" data-width="620" data-title="" data-brand="" data-thumbnail="" data-download="true" data-may-embed="true"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2013 17:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/may/14/septendecennial-sing-along/</guid><enclosure url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast13bugmusic.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><category>cicadas</category><category>david_rothenberg</category><category>discovery_dialogues</category><category>life</category><category>music</category><category>shorts</category><media:content url="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast13bugmusic.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:description type="plain">The Septendecennial Sing-Along</media:description><media:thumbnail url="https://media.wnyc.org/i/130/130/c/80/1/cicadas_bug_music_web.jpg" width="130" height="130" /><itunes:duration>17:58</itunes:duration><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every 17 years, a deafening sex orchestra hits the East Coast -- billions and billions of cicadas crawl out of the ground, sing their hearts out, then mate and die.

In this short, a beautiful answer to that question from Italo Calvino, read live by Liev Schreiber. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to one theory, the moon formed when a Mars-sized chunk of rock collided with Earth. After the moon coalesced out of the debris from that impact, it was much closer to Earth than it is today. This idea is taken to it's fanciful limit in Italo Calvino's story "The Distance of the Moon" (from his collection &lt;span class="book"&gt;&lt;a title="buy this book at Amazon" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156226006/radiolabbooks-20/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cosmicomics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, translated by William Weaver). The story, narrated by a character with the impossible-to-pronounce name Qfwfq, tells of a strange crew who jump between Earth and moon, and sometimes hover in the nether reaches of gravity between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reading was part of a live event hosted by Radiolab and Selected Shorts, and it originally aired on WNYC’s and PRI’s SELECTED SHORTS, paired with a Ray Bradbury classic, “All Summer in a Day,” read by musical theater star Michael Cerveris.
